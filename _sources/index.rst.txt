cleanX documentation
========================

Here is some general information about the cleanX package. We are working on
documentation for programmers and medical professionals with some coding
experience. For now documentation for professionals with less coding experience
can be found on our wiki. The documentation on this website is programmers
oriented.  
The cleanX package helps with data cleaning for two-dimensional medical images.
The idea is that given DICOMs or files of images, you can use the functions as 
APIs to build the basis for machine learning or certain other types of
algorithms.
You can use the package code to clean out data that would lower the quality of
your algorithm if the "uncleaned" data was included, and use also the code to
add augmented images.
